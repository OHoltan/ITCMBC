# ITCMBC Mortar Ballistics Computer

[MBC Available here](https://isgvc.com/ITCMBC/mbc.html)

ITCMBC is a mortar ballistics computer for arma inspired by the LHMBC used by the US military. It does not only do ballistics calculations, it allows the user to manage anything up to a howitzer platoon with ease with features ranging from location stores, to detailed sheafs and adjustments.

# Usage

## Configuration

#### 1. BCS Setup

**Alert To Splash**
This lets you configure how many seconds before splash you will be alerted of splash.

**Wind Resistance**
Not applicable anymore - may be re-implemented.

###### Firemission naming

Firemissions can be automatically generated with the format FMnnnn by default. The firemission names are used when missions are saved to stored positions. Configuring firemission naming is useful in persistent operations, or repeated operations in similar area with the same MBC.

**Firemission Code**

The two letters with which firemission names start.

**Firemission Start**

The number at which firemissions start.

#### 2. Battery setup

### Gun Type Compatibility

The gun type list has 5 entries, but 3 of these are for community specific modpacks, or testing.
The two guns left cover most arma communities current needs though:
 
- 60mm M6 Commando Mortar
    This is the 60mm mortar from the 3CB modpack.
- Mk6
    This is the ACE Mk6 mortar, and any mortar that implements its ballistics. The 3CB L16 for example is compatible with the Mk6.

#### 3. Location stores

Locations can be added here to be used in any of the firemission creation steps. The discard button will clear the whole list. Remember to press **save** after editing the list.

###### Friendly

The friendly toggle is used in the BCS for automated danger close messages. If you for example add in the location WITCHCRAFT 2 OP and make it friendly, the MBC will warn you of this. When firing close to multiple locations, it will list of every location that you are firing danger close to.

#### 4. Ammo Stores

Currently ammo types can be renamed, but these names will not be carried over into the firemission engagement screen, and names will have to manually be re-entered in the EOM screen.
